                    <h4>She was born on April 28, 1981 in Pomona, California, USA.

                        After school, she studied at the Atlantic Theater Company theater studio.

                        Some time after the birth of their daughter, the family moved to Biloxi, Mississippi. The family was not very prosperous, her father is a Mexican who was refused to be hired anywhere. As a result, he became a soldier. Three years later, her father, who served in the Air Force, was transferred back to California. After living there, they moved to Del Rio, Texas. The mother is half-French, half-Danish by origin, which means that for the vast majority of the neighbors she is a “damn immigrant”. When Jess was born, her parents were very young, there was no extra money in the house, and the house itself was a very relative concept. Jessica is not the only child in the family; she has a brother, Josh. Before the girl was nine years old, the family moved from state to state ten times. Already at the age of five, Jessica decided to become an actress. At twelve she went to acting classes, at thirteen she got her first role in her life. Not because she was so talented, but because the director liked her long hair.
                        She really wanted to become a real Hollywood star, for this she came to various castings in Beverly Hills every week. At first, she was offered roles in TV shows. In anticipation of a real role, she even had to advertise the computer game "Nintendo".
                        On the set of Flipper, Jessica was the victim of a kidnapping. She was kidnapped right off the set and demanded a hefty ransom that her poor parents couldn't pay. The girl was accidentally found in the trunk of a car, the criminals were never found.
                        But this incident got into the newspapers, and serious producers began to show interest in the fourteen-year-old Jessica. She even managed to star in a couple of episodes of the series "Beverly Hills 90210", and then received an offer from James Cameron,
                        Filming in the series, Jessica managed to visit Australia and Canada, where she got on the Dini Petty talk show.
                        In 2001, Jessica hit the first line of Maxim's Hot 100 Babe List.
                        Every year Jessica is gaining popularity. In 2003, she appeared in the movie "Honey", and in 2005 she starred in 3 films: Sin City, where she joined Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Benicio Del Toro, in the "Fantastic Four" she became the Invisible Woman and spun love with Mister Fantastic Ioan Gruffudd, and in the movie "Welcome to Paradise!" ran along the beach with Paul Walker.
                        In 2004, on the set of the film Fantastic Four, she met the charming assistant director Warren Cash. The public, accustomed to the fleeting romances of the stars on the set, at first did not pay much attention to the couple. But time passed, Jessica became a star of the first magnitude, and young people did not even think of leaving. On May 19, 2008, they got married, and a month later, on June 7, the couple had a daughter.
